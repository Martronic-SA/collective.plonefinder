   Ajax popup to reference plone contents.
   
   This code is an extraction of plonearticle explorer for referencables contents
   The intention is to make it usable for any content type in different situations :
   
   - for referencable fields with a special widget (collective.orderrefswidget which will come soon)
   
   - for collective.ploneckeditor (will also come soon) or any possible wysiwyg editor for referencing images or contents inside a rich text field,
     we also make possible in near future upload of files or images with this product (perhaps using collective.uploadify)
   
   - for links fields (as remoteUrl in ATLink) to reference internal links   
      
   
   Don't use it in a production site for now (this product is under developpement just for a specific usecase)
   
   TODO :

   - js refactoring
   
   - css refactoring
   
   - uploadify integration
