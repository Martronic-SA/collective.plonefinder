TODO (2010/08/04)
=================


- IEfixes (IE8 seems OK now, IE7 has some minor width height or position bugs, no more support for IE6)

- add new features for each browsed item (rename, change State, delete, copy/cut/paste), accessible if 
  allowobjactions == True

- make the entire ajax widget working (today only popup widget is operational used for ckeditor)
  in progress ... (need to improve js and add css/js in portal resources)

- add doctests

- i18n : other languages

- improve finder for selected elements :

  - add a view "selection", which list selected items
    easy to implement in js/css/template (always done in the view python code)

  - show selected items with a different style (a background color), 
    or hide it when showblackisted is off

  - add an ajax request to push selected items in blacklist in selectItem js method > then refresh

  - add a way to select multiple elements with checkboxes + apply an action with button (select, cut, paste, etc ...)
